# Inventory Tracker

This is a piece of paper that keeps information about what should be stored in a particular storage location. This makes it much easier to be aware when something is missing or out of place and also allows your heirs to know what they should expect to find in storage.

Its easy to forget what you've put in a location like a safety deposit box that you might not visit often. Being able to verify that everything that should be in storage is in storage (and that there aren't any odd items that shouldn't be there) at very least gives peace of mind, and at its most useful can allow you to prevent theft of your coins.

## Actions

### Creation

1. Create a [Paper Data Record](../backupMethods/Paper-Data-Record.md).
2. Write the following at the top:
   *This list keeps track of all items in this storage location, including this piece of paper itself. All items in the list that have not been signed out should be in this storage location. No items that are not in the list should be in this storage location. Each time you unlock the storage location, please verify that the contents of the storage container matches this inventory tracker, and verify that the signatures look authentic.*
3. Below that, create a table with the headers:

| Item Description | Sign In | Sign out |
| :--------------- | :------ | :------- |
|                  |         |          |

4. Store the paper and pencil (from the Paper Data Storage) in your storage location.
5. Follow the *Add* instructions for all items already contained in the storage location, the pencil, and the Inventory Tracker paper itself.

### Add

When storing a new item in the storage location:

1. Write the new item's description down. Add some description that identifies the object vs other objects that someone could replace it with (*for example, "yellow pencil*" instead of just "*pencil*").
2. Initial the "Sign In" column of the row for the new item.

## Remove

When are taking an item from storage (and relocking the storage without that item), even for a short period of time, do the following:

1. Initial the "Sign out" column of the row for the item.

If that item is eventually put back in storage, follow the *Add* instructions as if it were a brand new item (using a new row).

## Rationale

* This allows you to easily verify what items should be in storage, making it much harder for an attacker to steal or insert items without you being aware of it.
* Adding Inventory Tracker sheet itself to the Inventory tracker sheet makes it very clear whether or not it should or should not be in the storage location. If it is found outside the storage location, that is evidence the storage location has been tampered with, which may not be something that would be otherwise obvious, say, to your heirs after death.
* You sign your initials both when items are put in and put out so there is some means of detecting if an attacker attempted to remove or add an item without anyone knowing about it. If the initials are inspected, it is likely that someone can tell if they were forged or not.

## Open questions

* Would it be a good idea to add dates alongside the signatures? On one hand, dates could be abused by an attacker. However, if an attacker has access to your storage location, there are lots of problems there. On the other hand, dates might be legitimately useful for cross-checking, especially for heirs after death of the owner. However, I don't have a good picture of the pros and cons here.
