# On Your Person

Carrying something around with you is one way to keep an eye on something basically all the time. The downside is that your environment changes as you live your life, and that means constantly changing security conditions.

## Strengths

* You can usually tell if someone is trying to take something from you.
* If you lose it, you know more quickly than other storage methods.

## Weaknesses

* You can accidentally leave it somewhere and lose it.
* It can be stolen from you if you're not careful.
