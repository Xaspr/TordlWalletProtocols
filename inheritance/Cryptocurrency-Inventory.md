# Cryptocurrency Inventory

## Create

1. Create a [Paper Data Record](../backupMethods/Paper-Data-Record.md).

2. Write the following at the top:
   
<u>*Cryptocurrency Inventory*</u>
   *This list keeps track of the locations where my cryptocurrency is stored. This inventory is up to date as of the non-crossed-out date on the right.
   
3. Below that, create two columns:

| Currency Info  | Date Updated and Signature |
| :------------- | :------------------------- |
|                |                            |

4. In the *Currency Info* column, list all your accounts, devices, software, and physical storage locations and which assets can be accessed on each of them. Info might look like the following:

* "Account *[website]* may contain a small amount of *[list of types of assets]*. You can log into this account by [details about how to log in]."
* "Device *[device]* contains a *[large amount or small amount]* of *[list of types of assets]* using software *[software name]*. You can find wallet seed backups for this wallet at *[list of storage locations]*."
* "My will and other important information can be found at *[list of storage locations]*."

5. Once the inventory is listed out, write a date on the right and your signature next to it. *Note that the date + signature don't need to line up with any particular item in the Currency Info column.*

## Update

1. Cross out any info that is no longer accurate.
2. Add new info to bring the inventory up to date.
3. Cross out the old date, and write a new date. 

## Recommendations

* It is recommended that you **not** include amounts, even approximate amounts, of how much currency you own, because that can easily become out of date and cause problems for your heirs. 
* It's recommended you **do not** use custodial accounts if at all possible, and especially not for storing large amounts. Writing your 

## Rationale

* A paper record is used (rather than digital) so that it is easily updated on the fly, and is never accessible on a computer, where a digital thief might find it and use it to
