# Letter to Loved Ones

This letter is intended to educate your heirs so they have the information they need to safely and securely recover, distribute, and store any cryptocurrency you leave to them.

## Creation Instructions

1. Create a [Paper Data Record](Paper-Data-Record.md).
2. Write the following:
   *Dear {friends, family, estate},*
   *I own digital assets that aren’t held or controlled by third parties. I want to be sure that you can access them in case someday I can’t. Please read and understand this letter completely before you start moving and funds, before you contact any lawyer, Will executor, or other person helping you with these things, before you take any action. For help accessing these assets, please contact **[names of trusted knowledgeable friends, family, lawyers, etc]**. Do not access them unless I am dead, mentally injured, or otherwise indefinitely unable to access them myself.*
   *Remember, these assets aren’t held by a bank and mistakes may not be able to be fixed. Transfers must be done correctly or the funds could be lost forever. Closely watch everyone who helps and make sure you understand everything that is happening. Be extremely careful with “wallet backups” and "seeds" because anyone who sees them (eg takes a picture of it with their phone) may be able to steal the assets.*
   *Please note, in many jurisdictions only a court approved executor has the legal right to move or liquidate assets after death. Directing someone other than the executor to do this could create legal problems for that person even if they are simply following your wishes and have no mal intent.*
3. Ensure you've created a [Cryptocurrency Inventory](Cryptocurrency-Inventory.md), and that you'll store a copy of it with this letter.
4. If you own assets on an exchange or other custodial service, ensure you've created [Custodial Services Inheritance Instructions](Custodial-Services-Inheritance-Instructions.md) and that you'll store a copy of it with this letter. Then write the following:
   *I have assets on one or more custodial services. There may be cash or assets held there now. You should move these assets out of the exchange as quickly as possible because the exchange is not insured and if the system is hacked the funds might disappear without recourse. Information about which custodial services these are in a document titled "<u>Cryptocurrency Inventory</u>" that should be stored with this letter .*
   *In order to access these account you’ll need my usernames, passwords, and potentially PINs and security codes. Instructions for obtaining these things are in a document titled "<u>Custodial Services Inheritance Instructions</u>" that should be stored with this letter. For any accounts that are connected to my bank account, the bank account should be verified as mine. Once verified, the Will Executor should withdraw any cash balance to be deposited into that account and then from there distribute it in accordance with the most recent version of my Will (if there are multiple versions).*
5. If you own any assets on hardware devices, non-custodial software, or mobile apps, write the following:
   *I use one or more hardware wallets, pieces of non-custodial software, or mobile apps to store keys for most of my cryptocurrency holdings. In case you can't access my phone or other hardware devices, you can restore the funds using backup seeds. Additional instructions should exist that allow you to access those funds. Those instructions should be in this or another storage location. See the document titled "<u>Cryptocurrency Inventory</u>" that should be stored with this letter for more information about those storage locations.*
6. If you own assets on any multisig wallets, write the following:
   *Some of my cryptocurrency is stored on one or more multisig wallets. The currency is locked by more than one key, and in order to disburse them, you will need access to multiple keys, but not necessarily all of them. The additional instructions mentioned above give details about these keys.*
7. Write the following:
   *In order to liquidate these assets you’ll need to go through an exchange. It may be helpful to use **[recommended exchange]**, where I already have an account. In order to transfer these assets to others without liquidating them, each person must set up their own account to receive the assets. This is not something that can be done, in aggregate, by an executor, trustee, or third party for important security reasons. Any person who expects to receive cryptocurrency assets directly should make sure to  do some research and understand how to securely create, store, backup, and use a wallet before the currency is sent to them.*
8. Sign the document with your hand-written signature and date.

## Recommendations

* Its best to avoid using custodial services as much as possible.
