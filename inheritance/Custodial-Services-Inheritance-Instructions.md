# Custodial Services Inheritance Instructions

Ensuring that assets from a custodial service can be inherited isn't easy. You can either give a trusted individual (or two) information that allows them to access those services, perhaps in a sealed letter you ask them not to open unless you become incapacitated. You could also store that information in a safety deposit box you properly set up to be inherited. You could also leave details about your account in your Will, however most companies probably don't have good protocols for dealing with inheritance, and this could make recovering the assets in those accounts substantially more difficult. Its best to avoid using custodial services as much as possible. 



## Creation Instructions

1. Create a [Paper Data Record](Paper-Data-Record.md).
2. Write the following: 
   *<u>Custodial Services Inheritance Instructions</u>*
3. Write instructions for how to access your custodial services. 

## Rationale

* Any instructions you write for your heirs should be handwritten with a [Paper Data Record](Paper-Data-Record.md) that never touches a computer, since a file on an online computer can be stolen and used as a guide to stealing your custodial assets.
