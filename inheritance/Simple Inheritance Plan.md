# Simple Inheritance Plan

## Instructions

## Setup 

1. Create a [Cryptocurrency Inventory](Cryptocurrency-Inventory.md). Create multiple copies.
2. Create a [Holographic Will](Holographic-Will.md). Create multiple copies.
3. (*Optional*) Create a digital copy of your Will. Sign the digital copy with all master keys used for your primary wallets. Keep all signatures (in digital form, or printed out on paper in text form). Also make sure you write in your Will that it will be signed with the master keys from your primary wallets, and specify which items in the cryptocurrency inventory contain which master key (but of course don't write down your master key).
5. Put one copy of each of the above items in each of your storage locations.

### Update

1. Create a new *Will and Testament* as described in steps 2 and (optionally) 3 of the *Setup* instructions. 
2. Go to each storage location and replace the copy of the Will and follow the update instructions in [Cryptocurrency Inventory](Cryptocurrency-Inventory.md).
