# Non-master Password

This method is for creating and using passwords who's loss may result in unrecoverable loss of data or an account, but aren't one of the 1-3 master passphrases you choose to remember. Humans have limited memory, and should only attempt to remember a handful of passphrases.

Use the instructions for [Non-critical Password](Non-critical-Passphrase.md) with the caveat that storing critical passwords in chrome is not recommended. Backing up the password manager database in multiple redundant places also becomes more important.
