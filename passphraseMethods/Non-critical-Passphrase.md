# Non-critial Password

This method is for creating and using a non-critical password, such as one for most websites. Most passwords fall under this cateogry if they're used on a website where you can recover your account if you forget your password.

1. Choose a password manager to store the passphrase in. This should ideally be an open source piece of software like [KeePass or Passbolt](https://password-managers.bestreviews.net/best-open-source-password-managers/). Storing non-critical passwords in chrome is also usually ok, tho not recommended for financial accounts. If your password manager is secured with a passphrase, use a [Basic Master Passphrase](Basic Master Passphrase.md) for that.
2. Choose a unique password. You should not use the same password for any two different accounts. Choose a random sequence of 15-20 letters and numbers with random capitalization. Don't bother trying to remember it. A good password manager should be available on your phone as well as on a desktop computer.

## Rationale

1. Password managers protect many passwords behind a single master password allows you to have strong unique passwords for each website and service you use without having to remember them. You only need to remember your master password. The more important a password, the more careful you should be with it.
2. Unique passwords are important because many companies don't properly store passwords in a way that keeps them safe. Companies are often hacked and have customers' data stolen. Companies often store passwords in plain text, or store them in another insecure way that allows the data-theives to access an account from another companies, if you use the same password for that other account.
