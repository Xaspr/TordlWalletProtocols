# Metal Backups

Better than a paper backup because its much more difficult to lose information on steel plates. The primary risk with this is that someone steals one of your backups and manages to discover or brute force your password (which is why a strong password is neccessary). A secondary risk with this setup is that if *all* your backups are lost or stolen in the time between when you verify them *and* you lose access to your primary wallet, your bitcoin will be lost.

Variable Parameters:

* 1 seed
* 2 or more ~$30 Steel backup plate
* Tamper-evident storage locations
* Frequency of backup verification

## Steps

1. Buy 2 or more metal backups.
2. Stamp seed on all backup plates.
3. Store each seed in different locations (eg at home and in a safety deposit box). If your seed is passphrase protected (which it should be), there's no particular need for this to be behind an additional lock since if you lose it or its stolen, you have at least one additional backup. You can even give this to a responsible friend.
4. Verify that all backups are still in your posession regularly (eg once a year).

## Metal Backup Options

The following lists the best known metal backup options:

* Blockplate
* Steelwallet

## Choosing storage locations

There are three important properties a backup should have:

1. It should be verifiable, ie you should be able to easily verify that the backup still exists and hasn't been lost, damaged, or corrupted.
2. It should be tamper-evident, meaning it should be likely that you'll notice if someone has broken into or tampered with your backup or its storage location.

Types of recommended storage locations:

* Home safe
* Bank safety deposit box

Different types of storage locations should be chosen for each backup copy. For example, do not store all copies in safety depsoit boxes.

### Safety Deposit Boxes

Note that safety deposit boxes [cannot always be trusted](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/business/safe-deposit-box-theft.html). When looking for a safety deposit box, you should find one that is insured to a significant dollar value by the bank that offers the safety deposit box, so their interests are aligned with keeping your items safe. Getting external insurance means the bank won't care if they screw up and lose your valuables. It seems most banks do not offer such insurance, and so such a safety deposit box should not be 

The alternative is a safe, which would keep your seed somewhat safe from physical theft and would at least probably make it evident that your seed was stolen so you could take action (by creating a new wallet with a different seed).
