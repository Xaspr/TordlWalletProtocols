# Permanent Paper Data Record

This is a durable written record where the information is intended to remain unchanged after writing. Any changes made to the record will be obvious.

## Variable Parameters

* `title`
* `main contents`

## Instructions

1. Create a [Paper Data Record](Paper-Data-Record.md).
2. Use a straight edge to draw evenly spaced lines on the paper. The lines should be just large enough to fit the letters at the size you will write them. When you write, the height of your letters should fill the line. 
3. For every page you use, write the following in the top line (leaving space after "of" to fill in the total number of pages later):
   "*<u>**`title`**</u>, Page **`page number`** of*"
4. Write your document's contents.
5. When the record is complete, fill in the total number of pages after each "of" on the first line (so that it reads, for example, "*Last Will and Testament of Dan Quede, Page 1 of 5*").
6. Cross out all empty lines on all pages and cross out any empty unused space on lines that have writing on them. Also cross out any large empty space that was not divided into lines.

## Rationale

* Acid-free alkaline or archival paper is thought to be able to last 200-1000 years, depending on the quality.
* India ink will last basically [as long as the paper](http://youaskandy.com/questions-answers/25-article-series-1950/15719-what-is-india-ink-made-of.html) its written on. Pencil does not fade as quickly as pen, and can last for 50 years or more if kept in neutral conditions (away from light, heat, moisture, movement, etc).
* Writing in you own handwriting allows heirs to use handwriting analysis as one method of verifying that the record was written by you.
