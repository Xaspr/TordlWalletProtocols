# Paper Data Record

This is a flexible, semi-durable storage method that makes it easy to keep and update plain-text information without using any machines. 

## Instructions

Write on **acid-free, alkaline, or archival paper** (~$10 for a box) with an **india ink pen** (~$10). A **pencil** would also work if you're ok with the record being potentially modified. 

## Rationale

* Acid-free alkaline or archival paper is thought to be able to last 200-1000 years, depending on the quality.
* India ink will last basically [as long as the paper](http://youaskandy.com/questions-answers/25-article-series-1950/15719-what-is-india-ink-made-of.html) its written on. Pencil does not fade as quickly as a normal pen, and can last for 50 years or more if kept in neutral conditions (away from light, heat, moisture, movement, etc).
* Writing in you own handwriting allows heirs to use handwriting analysis as one method of verifying that the record was written by you.
