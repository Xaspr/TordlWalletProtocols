# Metal Backups

Better than a paper backup because its much more difficult to lose information on steel plates. The primary risk with this is that someone steals one of your backups and manages to discover or brute force your password (which is why a strong password is neccessary). A secondary risk with this setup is that if *all* your backups are lost or stolen in the time between when you verify them *and* you lose access to your primary wallet, your bitcoin will be lost.
