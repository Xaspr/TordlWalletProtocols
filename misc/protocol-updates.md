# Protocol Updates

1. Check for new protocol releases at https://github.com/fresheneesz/TordlWalletProtocols/releases.
2. If there is a newer release, download the newest release.
3. In the main `README.md` file in the *Release Notes* section, check the protocol errata (a log of errors in previous versions) for all the versions since the last time you ran through this process (or if this is the first time, for all versions after the version your wallet uses, which is recorded in your `unencrypted Digital Data Record`).
4. Make any necessary corrections based on those errata. Any recommendations are prominently mentioned at the top of the notes for each version. 
5. If you want to upgrade, check the *Upgrade Guidance* section for each of the versions you checked in step 3.
