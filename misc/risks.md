# Risks

## Accidents

* **Death / Incapacitation**.
* **Memory Loss**.
* **Disaster**. An unexpected event that can destroy stored data or prevent access to it. For example, fire, flood, tornado, riots, war, etc.
* **Data rot**. Corruption of critical stored data from wear or decay over time.
* **Software rot**. Most protocols depend on the availability and compatibility of software with your seeds and other information created and kept for a wallet. But if your funds are stored for a long time, software may become difficult to find, or your keys may even no longer work within the system. The second is hopefully unlikely for a coin that has a policy of maintaining backwards compatibility. 
* **User Error**. Typos, weak passwords, incorrectly performed steps, etc.
* **Process Fatigue**. When complexity of the process causes steps to be skipped or done incorrectly.
* **Unknown security threats**. Any protocol may contain weaknesses which are currently undiscovered â€“ perhaps related to attacks which are not part of the current security landscape. 

## Attacks

* **Remote Theft**. Theft of data via malicious software where the attacker did not have physical access to any hardware.
* **Transaction Alteration**. When transaction information, like the address or amount, is altered by malicious software before the transaction is presented for signing. 
* **Social Engineering**. 
* **Opportunistic Physical Theft**. Unsophisticated thefts of convenience.
* **Targeted Physical Theft**. Sophisticated attacks that attempt gain physical access to your devices or stored data. For example, key-loggers, lock picking, and breaking-and-entering.
* **Supply-chain Attack**. Hardware that has been compromised by a malicious actor in the supply-chain, like the manufacturer, distributor, transporter, or even the designers themselves.
* **$5 Wrench Attack**. The threat or act of immediate violence in order to coerce someone into telling secret information or send money to the attacker's wallet. This
* **Hostage Attack**. Taking someone's loved one hostage in order to coerce that someone to send money to the attackers.
* **Betrayal**. Someone you trusted with keys or other privileged access who uses their access to steals your funds.
* **Denial of Access**. When a bank, government, or other entity intentionally prevents you from accessing the data you need to use your wallet or keep it safe.
