# Storage Location Compromised

If one of your storage locations has been compromised:

* New seeds should be created for all host devices.
* If there's any reason to believe your passphrases have been compromised, use new passphrases for all seeds as well. 
* Do not reuse any storage location or device that you think might have been compromised.

## Rationale

If one storage location is noticeably compromised, it may be likely that other storage locations are also compromised (noticeably or not). Anything that may give a thief an advantage should be nullified as soon as possible.
