# Storage and backup basics

There are three important properties a backup should have:

1. It should be verifiable, ie you should be able to easily verify that the backup still exists and hasn't been lost, damaged, or corrupted.
2. It should be tamper-evident, meaning it should be likely that you'll notice if someone has broken into or tampered with your backup or its storage location.
3. It should be theft-resistant and damage-resistant.
