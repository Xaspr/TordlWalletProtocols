# General Security Risks

These are the security risks that any wallet protocol has:

* **Loss of seeds**. If too many private keys are lost, funds will be lost.
* **Theft of private keys and passphrases**. If too many private keys become known to a thief, funds can be stolen.
* **Weak passphrases**. If you choose a passphrase that is too weak, it may be crackable leading to reduced security. 
* **Bit rot**. Most protocols depend on the availability and compatibility of software with your seeds and other information created and kept for a wallet. But if your funds are stored for a long time, software may become difficult to find, or your keys may even no longer work within the system. The second is hopefully unlikely for a coin that has a policy of maintaining backwards compatibility. 
* **Unknown security threats**. Any protocol may contain weaknesses which are currently undiscovered â€“ perhaps related to attacks which are not part of the current security landscape.
