# Simple Inheritance Plan

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a cryptocurrency inventory which consists of a list of accounts, devices, software, and physical storage locations and which assets can be accessed on each of them. It might look like the following:
   * Account [website] may contain a small amount of [list of types of assets].
   * Device [device] contains a [large amount or small amount] of [list of types of assets] using software [software name].
   * At [storage location] you can find wallet seed backups for [which wallet listed above], my will, a copy of these instructions, and other important information.
2. Add the following to the inventory you created above:
   * For help accessing these assets, please contact [names of trusted knowlegeable people]. Be aware that these assets likely cannot be recovered if they are stolen, so please watch all helpers carefully.
   * Your signature.
   * The date.
3. Write a will in your own hand writing in pencil.
4. Copy the will to a text file and sign it with all keys used for your wallets. Keep a copy of the text file and signatures in each of your storage locations in digital form on a disk or printed out on paper.
